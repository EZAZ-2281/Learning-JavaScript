JavaScript Values
The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

* Fixed values
* Variable values
Fixed values are called Literals.

Variable values are called Variables.
```
```
JavaScript Expressions
An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.

The computation is called an evaluation.

For example, 5 * 10 evaluates to 50
```
```
"Golam" + " " + "Kibria"
```
```
Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions.

A JavaScript name must begin with:

A letter (A-Z or a-z)
A dollar sign ($)
Or an underscore (_)
```
```
Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.
