```
let x = 5;
x++;
let z = x; //6
```
```
let x = 5;
x--;
let z = x; //4
```
```
let x = 5;
let z = x ** 2; // result is 25
```
```
let x = 5;
let z = Math.pow(x,2); // result is 25
```

-> Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).

-> When using parentheses, the operations inside the parentheses are computed first.

-> When many operations have the same precedence (like addition and subtraction), they are computed from left to right:
Example
let x = 100 + 50 - 3;
```
```
