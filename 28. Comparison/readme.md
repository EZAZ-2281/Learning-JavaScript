```
5 === 5	true
5 === "5" false
```
```
When comparing two strings, "2" will be greater than "12", because (alphabetically) 1 is less than 2.
```
```
When comparing a string with a number, JavaScript will convert the string to a number when doing the comparison. An empty string converts to 0. A non-numeric string converts to NaN which is always false.
