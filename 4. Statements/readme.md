```
JavaScript statements are composed of:

Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.
```
```
Ending statements with semicolon is not required, but highly recommended.
```
```
A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / )
```
```
* JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.

* The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.
