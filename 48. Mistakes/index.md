```
let x = 10;
let y = 5;
let z = x + y;     // Now z is 15

let x = 10;
let y = "5";
let z = x + y;     // Now z is "105"
```
```
JavaScript will allow you to break a statement into two lines:

Example 1
let x =
"Hello World!";
But, breaking a statement in the middle of a string will not work:

Example 2
let x = "Hello
World!";
You must use a "backslash" if you must break a statement in a string:

Example 3
let x = "Hello \
World!";
```
```
let x = 5 + 7;       // x.valueOf() is 12,  typeof x is a number
let x = 5 + "7";     // x.valueOf() is 57,  typeof x is a string
let x = "5" + 7;     // x.valueOf() is 57,  typeof x is a string
let x = 5 - 7;       // x.valueOf() is -2,  typeof x is a number
let x = 5 - "7";     // x.valueOf() is -2,  typeof x is a number
let x = "5" - 7;     // x.valueOf() is -2,  typeof x is a number
let x = 5 - "x";     // x.valueOf() is NaN, typeof x is a number
```
```
0 == "";        // true
1 == "1";       // true
1 == true;      // true

0 === "";       // false
1 === "1";      // false
1 === true;     // false
```
```

```
