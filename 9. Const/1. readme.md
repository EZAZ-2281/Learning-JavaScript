```
Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.
Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.
Variables defined with const have Block Scope.
```
```
A const variable cannot be reassigned:
Example
const PI = 3.141592653589793; //must be assign with declaration
PI = 3.14;      // This will give an error
PI = PI + 10;   // This will also give an error
```
```
Incorrect:
const PI;
PI = 3.14159265359;
```
```
Use const when declare:
A new Array
A new Object
A new Function
```
```
Declaring a variable with const is similar to let when it comes to Block Scope.
const x = 10;
// Here x is 10

{
const x = 2;
// Here x is 2
}

// Here x is 10
```
```
var x = 2;     // Allowed
var x = 3;     // Allowed
x = 4;         // Allowed
```
```
Redeclaring an existing var or let variable to const, in the same scope, is not allowed:

Example
var x = 2;     // Allowed
const x = 2;   // Not allowed

{
let x = 2;     // Allowed
const x = 2;   // Not allowed
}

{
const x = 2;   // Allowed
const x = 2;   // Not allowed
}
```
```
Reassigning an existing const variable, in the same scope, is not allowed:

Example
const x = 2;     // Allowed
x = 2;           // Not allowed
var x = 2;       // Not allowed
let x = 2;       // Not allowed
const x = 2;     // Not allowed

{
  const x = 2;   // Allowed
  x = 2;         // Not allowed
  var x = 2;     // Not allowed
  let x = 2;     // Not allowed
  const x = 2;   // Not allowed
}
```
```
Redeclaring a variable with const, in another scope, or in another block, is allowed:

Example
const x = 2;       // Allowed

{
  const x = 3;   // Allowed
}

{
  const x = 4;   // Allowed
}
```
